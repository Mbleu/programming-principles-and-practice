// Functions that won't compile: - swap_cr() won't compile since its argument are const-references and it attempts to change them
//
// Calls that won't compile: - swap_r: - All calls involving literals fail to compile since you cannot change the value of a literal.
//										- Calls with cx and cy as arguments fail to compile since the function cannot channge the value of a constant.
//										- Call with dx and dy fail to compile since swap_r only accepts references to integers as arguments.
//											The compiler cannot perform an implicit conversion to double as it would in the case of an argument passed by value
//											since no new variable copy is being made here.
// 
// Test Results:	swap_v: - All calls compiled, however none had any effect on the original variables, constants and literals.
//								This is because the function takes copies of objects as arguments and changes those. It therefore never affects the original objects.
//					swap_r: - swap_r(x, y) then is the only function call that both compiled and performed as advertised.
